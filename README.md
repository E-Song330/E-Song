# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project


## Insights of Technology trend

This work is a technology trend analysis project based on Stack Overflow's survey data such as respondents' basic information, job information, programming language, and database.
The analysis consisted of the following steps:

1. Data collection
  * Collect job data from GitHub Jobs API, Scrape popular language data from web, and survey data(csv) from Stack overflow
  * Store the collected data into an excel spreadsheet and csv file
2. Data Wrangling
  * Identify duplicate rows in the data frame.
  * Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe
  * Find missing values for all columns
  * Normalize the data using two existing columns
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Identify the distribution of data in the dataset
  * Identify outliers in the dataset and remove it
  * Identify correlation between features in the dataset
4. Data Visualization
  * Visualize the distribution of data
  * Visualize the relationship between two features
  * Visualize composition of data
  * Visualize comparison of data
