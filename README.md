3. Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Identify the distribution of data in the dataset
  * Identify outliers in the dataset and remove it
  * Identify correlation between features in the dataset
4. Data Visualization
  * Visualize the distribution of data
  * Visualize the relationship between two features
  * Visualize composition of data
  * Visualize comparison of data
